<h1>Welcome to Café Code</h1>

<p>Code and algorithms are now part of nearly every aspect of society and intersect with nearly all disciplines. We need a space to think and talk more broadly about coding. Café Code is a forum for talking about code, sharing useful tutorials and tools, helping each other with coding problems, and discussing the broader issues of coding in society</p>
